Disease Pattern Clustering for Mortality Risk Prediction

Overview

Predict hospital patient mortality using diagnoses, disease clusters, and hybrid features with machine learning. This project compares Gradient Boosting, Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and SVM models.

Data Set:
Simulated EHR data sets used - unknown on real data sets

Features & Models

Feature sets: Diagnoses, patient clusters, hybrid combinations

Models:

Gradient Boosting (best: learning_rate=0.1, max_depth=3, n_estimators=100)

Random Forest (conservative grid)

Logistic Regression (balanced classes, C âˆˆ {0.1,1,10})

SVM (probability enabled for ROC-AUC)

Evaluation: ROC-AUC, validation/test splits (70/20/10)

Quick Start
Requirements
pip install -r requirements.txt

Run Pipeline
python run_pipeline.py


Outputs: model metrics, ROC curves, and feature importance plots.

Results

Best Model: Gradient Boosting

Validation AUC: 0.914

Test AUC: 0.920

Notes

Hyperparameters chosen conservatively to balance performance, interpretability, and computational cost.

Pipeline handles model failures gracefully.
